**Authors:** Atlanta Liu, Dany Hachem, Greg Cameron

### What's in this repository?

  This repository contains a final group project from the data visualization course, which is part of the data science program at the University of Calgary. The dataset used in this project is available online for public use at the Open Calgary website. The overarching goal was to demonstrate our knowledge of data wrangling in Pandas and visualize how various factors have affected the prices of the property assessments in Calgary through an exploratory data analysis. Using Jupyter notebook as our main environment, we visualized how prices have changed through a series of interactable widgets in Plotly as well as provided some geographical visualizations of how various neighbourhoods have been affected with the rises and decreases of each factor. This repository also contains our final powerpoint presentation that we have used to summarize our visual findings for our class.

The three contributing factors we looked at in regards to property assessments includes:

- Oil Price Fluctuation
- Population Growth 
- Crime Rates
