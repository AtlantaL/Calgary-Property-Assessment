# Calgary Property Assessment: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Authors:** Atlanta Liu, Dany Hachem, Greg Cameron

**Date:** Fall 2020

This repository consists of a final project from the data visualization course, which is part of the data science program at the University of Calgary. The dataset used in this project is available online for public use at the Open Calgary website. The overarching goal was to demonstrate our knowledge of data wrangling in Pandas and visualize how various factors have affected the prices of the property assessments in Calgary. Using Jupyter notebook as our main environment, we visualized the data through a series of interactable widgets in Plotly as well as provided some geographical visualizations of how various neighbourhoods have been affected by the rises and decreases of each factor. The three factors we looked at are listed below:

- Oil Price Fluctuation
- Population Growth 
- Crime Rates

Alongside the code is also a powerpoint presentation and our initital proposal.
